# PrimeSieve

Performs a benchmark test on your CPU by checking how fast it can generate the Sieve of Erathosnes for increasingly large intervals (starting from $0$ to $5\times 10^7$ and ending at $0$ to $105\times 10^6$.)

Each run is timed and saved to a csv file which can then be opened in Excel for visualisation.
