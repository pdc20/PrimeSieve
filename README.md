# PrimeSieve

Performs a benchmark test on your CPU by checking how fast it can generate the Sieve of Erathosnes for increasingly large intervals (starting from 0 to 5 * 10^7 and ending at 0 to 105 * 10^7.)

Each run is timed and saved to a csv file which can then be opened in Excel for visualisation.

The GUI for the program was created using Swing.

# Ideas for Future Releases
- Allow user to decide intervals and number of runs.
